    <!-- Methodology -->
    <section id="methodology" class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">3. Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        The data collection process involved executing specific search queries on three major commercial supplier websites: WebstaurantStore, Amazon, and Uline. Queries targeted keywords such as "coffee machine office use," "commercial coffee maker best value," and "espresso machine office bulk purchase" to capture a broad spectrum of relevant products. Search results were filtered for relevance and product details were extracted, including pricing, specifications, and vendor information. Products were then ranked based on suitability for office use and value proposition. Price comparisons were tabulated and visualized to highlight cost differences and trends.

    <!-- Analysis -->
    <section id="analysis" class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">5. Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The price comparison reveals a significant range in cost and capacity among the evaluated coffee machines. The Zulay Premium Commercial Coffee Urn, priced at $159.99 after discount, offers a large 100-cup capacity and durable stainless steel construction, making it a cost-effective option for large office settings. Conversely, the Blended Reverse Osmosis System from WebstaurantStore, priced at $419.99, is a more specialized commercial brewer with a smaller capacity but advanced features suitable for high-volume or customizable setups.
      </p>
      <p>
        The discount offered on the Zulay product enhances its value proposition, while the WebstaurantStore product’s price reflects its advanced capabilities and commercial-grade build. Both products cater to different office needs: the Zulay urn is ideal for bulk coffee service, whereas the WebstaurantStore system suits offices requiring hot beverage versatility and customization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The search results from Amazon and WebstaurantStore consistently show a variety of commercial coffee machines with features such as programmable timers, removable tanks, and multiple brewing sizes. Uline’s offerings focus more on bulk supplies and automatic brewers, which may complement coffee machine procurement but were not highlighted in the final product selection due to limited detailed pricing data.
